                <h3>About the Illustrator</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Darin is a 21 year old college student who lives with autism and likes to draws in his free time. He specializes in producing vector art on Adobe Illustrator and is completely self taught. He particularly enjoys drawing things from his daily life and from fiction which inspires him. When Darin isn't drawing on Adobe Illustrator, he likes to watch movies, play video games, and read. These interests show in his artwork, where he often seeks to replicate iconic brands, books, and characters.
                    <br><br>
                    While Darin is not a professional artist, he wants to share his illustrations on the web to inspire others with Autism and show them that autism does not prevent anyone from pursuing their passion and putting themselves out there.
